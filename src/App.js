// Re-read React documentation sections on props, components, hooks, lifting state, and other sections. I wanted to connect the generate image compoinent to an onClick event. My code started getting crazy again.

// Then researched react random generators for advice and image generators for cats and dogs, looking at different approaches.

import React from 'react';
import './App.css';

function Header() {
	return (
		<div className="header___main">
			<h1>Cats</h1>
		</div>
	);
}

export default Header;
