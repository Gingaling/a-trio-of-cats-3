// I wanted to connect the generate image component to an onClick event. Re-read React documentation sections on props, components, hooks, lifting state, and other sections. 

// Then researched react random generators for advice and image generators for cats and dogs, looking at different approaches. I did find guidance at https://hackernoon.com/cats-taking-over-how-to-make-a-random-cat-image-generator-with-react-and-cat-api-ke3s3wrg.

import React from 'react';
import './App.css';

function Header() {
	return (
		<div className="header">
			<h1>A Trio of Cats</h1>
		</div>
	);
}

export default Header;
