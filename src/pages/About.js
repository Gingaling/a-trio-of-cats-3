				This app arose from a project assignment during my participation in a
				Winter/Spring 2022{' '}
				<a href="https://www.https://generalassemb.ly/">General Assembly</a>
				 Software Immersion Program cohort.
			</p>

				The app is fairly straightforward. The user may randomly generate an
				image of a cat. In addition. In addition, the user may view other pages for additional information. There is link to navigate back home as well.
