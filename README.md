**Description:**
My app is called *A Trio of Cats, Less Two*. It is a single-page application created with ReactJS and styled utilizing Flexbox. The app appropriately uses the *useState* hook, a new feature in the most recent React upgrade. The app incorporates the use of a fetch operation to a third party API and uses retrieved data. In this case, it is random cat imagess. Further the app demonstrates the use of calling a component with state through via an onClick event. The current project was a re-attempt after a dismal submission during the initial project period.

The app is deployed at: https://xenodochial-heisenberg-1997c1.netlify.app/
